This is the new Charity system.

After unpacking, go to the sub-directory "src", type "./makeall" to build all
the executables. To save space, type "./cleanup" to clean those intermediate
files.

To play with the system, go to the "test" directory, type "./charity filename"
to compile and run a program. For example, to run the "fundef.ch" file,
type "./charity fundef". Don't add the ".ch" suffix as the system will add it
automatically.
