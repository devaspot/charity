You need flex and bison to build this source.

I've added GNU autoconf support, hopefully this works properly.  To
build the Charity interpreter you should be in the base directory of the
source (where this file is found) and run the following commands:

./configure
make

You should then find the Charity interpreter, called charity, in the
base directory.

The following configure options are useful:
  --enable-efence	Enable Electric Fence memory debugger, argument
  gives the required linking options (eg. the full path and name of the
  .a file, or the appropriate -L and -l flags).

Building an RPM
---------------

The sources include a spec-file for the Redhat package manager used with
many Linux systems.  To build a Charity binary rpm just run

rpm -tb charity-1.99.gz

this should leave the rpm file in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/.  Be warned that
this process actually installs the charity interpreter on your system.
You can then install the rpm and all should be well.
